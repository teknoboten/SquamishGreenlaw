    <p class="lead mt-4">
      Hi! I‚Äôm Lauren: a geologist and mother, gratefully living with my family in S·∏µwxÃ±w√∫7mesh (Squamish). I love spending time in nature: biking, hiking, running, walking, paddling, cold dipping, whatever! If I‚Äôm outside, I‚Äôm pretty happy. I‚Äôm running for council because I want to represent my community in making long-term decisions in the best interest of the people, land, and waters of Squamish.</p>

      <p>In terms of experience I have dedicated the last 24 years to studying the earth. I have a B.Sc. Eng. in Geological Engineering, an M.Sc. in Geochemistry, and 15 years of experience as a geochemist. For the last 7 years I‚Äôve been raising my family and working intermittently as a science show host, geochemist or teacher at Quest.</p>

    <p>
      I believe that councillors should understand the values of their community, work together as a team, and represent their constituents best interest. My campaign platform is built upon three pillars: livability, affordability and environment.
    </p>

    <p>With the help of public feedback and a great team (mostly moms) sharing our talents and ideas, I hope to have the opportunity to serve my community in municipal government come October 15th. </p>

    <p class="lead mt-2">Lack of affordable housing is hollowing out our community. We are all losing friends, family and essential workers because it is so expensive to live here, the rental market does not meet demand, and the rental market is volatile. My priorities as a councillor will include:
    </p>
    
    <div>
      <h5>Development of lower-priced units to improve accessibility of the housing market</h5>
      <h5>Bringing more rental units to the market</h5>
      <h5>Ear marking housing for essential workers (eg health care, childcare workers, and teachers)</h5>

<li class="question" id="lng"> 
        <button class="btn-faq btn-faq-selected" type="button">Where do you stand on LNG?</button>

        <div class="hidden expanded">
          <p class="lead">
            In my opinion as a geologist, We need to move away from LNG. I can go on about this at length, but the main problems are:<br>
          

            <ul>
              <li>it‚Äôs 90% fracked (which is an extremely destructive process to entire ecosystems, not to mention the irreversible contamination of groundwater/drinking water)</li>
              <li>it has a BIG carbon footprint, because of the energy intensive extraction and shipping methods it requires</li>
              <li>it prolongs our dependence on fossil fuels which we absolutely must move away from.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
          Climate change is happening in real time. We are in a lot of trouble. If you‚Äôre skeptical or on the fence about the seriousness of the issue, The IPCC <a class="ctext" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/">regularly publishes excellent reports.</a>
          </p>
      </div>
</li>

<li class="my-4 question" id="the-spit"> 
      <button class="btn-faq btn-faq-selected" type="button">How do you feel about the spit?</button>

      <div class="hidden expanded">
        <p class="lead my-2">
        The spit! What a beloved and special place. My understanding is that the spit was directly impacting herring and salmon populations. These are critical species in our food webs and ecosystems, and right now many of our ecosystems need all the help they can get. 
        </p><br>
        <p>
        Unfortunately we are living in a time that requires us to reconsider how we co-exist with nature, which will sometimes mean giving up some things that we love. I don‚Äôt know all of the details of the biological baseline reports, which I‚Äôm sure were thorough for a decision this big, but my hope is that by removing the spit we see a noted increase in biodiversity in Howe Sound and the estuary.
        I still see people out there playing in the wind, and this gives me hope that we can make ecologically sound decisions, and still enjoy our natural playground.

<li class="my-4 question" id="why-squamish"> 
    <button class="btn-faq btn-faq-selected" type="button">How long have you been in Squamish, and what brought you here?</button>

    <div class="hidden expanded">
      <p class="lead my-2">
        We‚Äôve been here for 4 years. We moved here for the great outdoors: trails, rivers & mountains. Also because we had good friends living here and we wanted to raise our kids here. We love this place and we hope to make it home for generations.
      </p>
</li>

<li class="my-4 question" id="funding"> 
  <button class="btn-faq btn-faq-selected" type="button">How are you paying for your campaign?</button>

  <div class="hidden expanded">
    <p class="lead my-2">
      So far I am completely self-funded, which means I have a total budget of 2500$. I have received some ‚ÄúIn-kind‚Äù donations from generous friends who are helping me set up the website and posters.
    </p>
  </div>
</li>

<li class="my-4 question" id="why-you"> 
  <button class="btn-faq btn-faq-selected" type="button">Why do you think you would be a good councillor?</button>

  <div class="hidden expanded">
    <p class="lead my-2">
      I am passionate, not easily dissuaded and believe I would be a good advocate for the people of Squamish. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy problem solving and could excel at finding optimal solutions for complicated problems. I feel strongly that the government should act in the best interest of the most vulnerable and I want to empower people to engage with their government to build the community they want to be a part of. 
    </p>
  </div>
</li>

<li class="my-4 question" id="time"> 
  <button class="btn-faq btn-faq-selected" type="button">Do you currently have another job / time commitments? Will you have enough time to commit to this job?</button>

  <div class="hidden expanded">
    <p class="lead my-2">
      I am not currently employed outside the home, nor do I have any conflicts of interest.
    </p>

    <p> The lack of affordable / quality childcare in town prevented me from returning to work full-time, but now that they are in school part-time, I am eager to get involved in the community.</p>

  </div>
</li>

<li class="my-4 question" id="densification"> 
  <button class="btn-faq btn-faq-selected" type="button">What are your thoughts on densification?</button>

  <div class="hidden expanded">
    <p class="lead my-2">
      Because of our ongoing housing crisis, development is a necessity. From the environmental and infrastructure perspectives, densification- in the right ways- makes more sense than the alternative, which is sprawl. 
    </p><br>
    <p>
      That said- it is important to me to maintain Squamish‚Äôs small-town feel downtown and to preserve those stunning views. As councillor, I will carefully consider our town's long term livability when it comes to development.
  </div>
</li>

<li class="my-4 question" id="theatre"> 
  <button class="btn-faq btn-faq-selected" type="button">Please share your goals and opinions on the importance of a community theatre </button>

  <div class="hidden expanded">
    <p class="lead my-2">
      I would love to have a new theatre in Squamish! I think it would be fantastic to have a multi-use theater where plays, musicals, live music, film festivals and movie screenings could take place, especially as our population continues to grow and with so many young people here.
    </p><br> 
    
    <p>
      I believe community theatre is important and it would be beneficial to the community to have a new theatre.
    </p>
      
  </div>
</li>

<li class="my-4 question" id="wasteless"> 
  <button class="btn-faq btn-faq-selected" type="button">What are your ideas on how Squamish can work towards a wasteless future?</button>

  <div class="hidden expanded">
    <p class="lead my-2">

      For right now- it would be great to streamline our recycling programs, educate the public about Reducing before Recycling and Reusing, and upgrading our composting facilities. 
      I would love to see Squamish adopting the <a class="ctext" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut_(economic_model)">Doughnut Economics model</a>, similar to the city of <a class="ctext" href="https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/nanaimo-council-decides-city-will-be-guided-by-doughnut-economic-model/">Nanaimo.</a></p><br>
      <p>
      Doughnut economics moves us from an impossible economic model of infinite growth in a finite system, to an economic model that stays within the constraints of our natural resources while simultaneously supporting our most vulnerable. This in part means minimizing waste production, and also maximizing the use of waste. </p>
      </p>

      <p>I also love the idea of shifting from cradle to grave designs to <a class="ctext" href="https://sustainabilityguide.eu/methods/cradle-to-cradle/">cradle to cradle</a>, which means that products are just as valuable at the end of their lives as at the beginning, as it is in nature.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      On a non municipal level I have a few thoughts about this I think we need consumer protections around packaging, and I wonder if Consumer Protection Agencies could pivot their efforts to things like: packaging regulations (moving towards compostable packaging for foods and goods), right to repair, and combating planned obsolescence of electronics.
